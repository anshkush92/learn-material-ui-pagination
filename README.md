This Project was made to learn how to use the **Material UI pagination** but along with that I thought to ***refactor*** my code, so in that journey I ended up **learning / revising** my old concepts and learning new things like 

 - **Redux Toolkit** Usage with TypeScript 
 - Usage of the **Custom Hooks** for fetching Data 
 - Using **.env** file in React
 - **Refactoring** the Code
 - Also learnt how to **deploy site** which contains **.env** 
	 - Just make sure to write the .env variable value **without** `""` in **netlify**

Code is divided into different branches and **each branch name** signifies the part which I have learnt in that 

You can check out the [Resources](https://github.com/anshkush92college/learn-material-ui-pagination/blob/done/Resources.md) for learning what I have learnt and becoming better
